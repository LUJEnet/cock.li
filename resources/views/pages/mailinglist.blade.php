@section('content')
<p>cock.li has a rather active mailing list. you don't need an @cock.li email address to join, but keep in mind that the mailing list can get as much as 100 posts per hour. you'll want to set up a filter if you're going to use an email account you already use.</p>

<h3>how to join</h3>
<p>email <a href="mailto:mailman-join@lists.cock.li">mailman-join@lists.cock.li</a> and respond to the confirmation email.</p>

<h3>how to leave</h3>
<p>email <a href="mailto:mailman-unsubscribe@lists.cock.li">mailman-unsubscribe@lists.cock.li</a> and respond to the confirmation email.</p>

<h3>reply style (top- or bottom-posting)</h3>
<p>if you strictly use partial quoting (either remove the quote or only partially quote), then bottom posting is fine. otherwise, reply on top. <b>don't reply on bottom if you're going to make people scroll past miles of quotes.</b></p>

<h3>how to post to mailing list</h3>
<p>once you're subscribed, email <a href="mailman@lists.cock.li">mailman@lists.cock.li</a> with your post. It will be copied to everyone in the list</p>

<h3>how to reply to a post</h3>
click "Reply List" or "Reply all". if you click "Reply" you will privately email the person who posted.
