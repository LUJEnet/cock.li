  Cock.li is your go-to solution for professional E-mail addresses and XMPP addresses. Since 2013 cock.li has provided stable E-mail services to an ever-increasing number of users. Cock.li allows registration and usage using Tor and other privacy services (proxies, VPNs) and is run by "some dude", not a business. I use this E-mail service personally so I have a vested interest in keeping it up, stable, and secure.

    <h2 style='margin-top: 0'>NAZI PROPELLANT DEPLOYED. USERNAME RESERVATION ACTIVATED</h2>
    <p>
      The Germans have demonstrated they do not give a fuck about anything except their weird scat fetishes, and I have given up hope that the HDDs will ever be returned. The prosecutor, JÃ¼rgen Pfeiffer, is throwing every obstacle possible and has demonstrated I won't see those drives any time soon. So, in the face of incompetent government (honestly, it was wishful thinking to think otherwise) I have deployed my alternative plan to get cock.li registration enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you lost a username in the raid (which means you registered between December 22 and January 15), you can reserve it by logging in (to a different / new account) and clicking "Reserve Old Username" in the User menu. Other details are on that page.
    </p>
    <p>Registration for all domains will be re-enabled on <strong>JUNE 10, 2016</strong>. The great cock will stand at full-mast once again and the Phallic Reich will reign for a thousand years.</p>

        The donation goal for this month has been reached! Thanks for your support. Instead of donating to cock.li this month, would you please donate to <strong><a href='https://whisper.networkforgood.com/'>my lawyer</a></strong>? She has represented the site pro-bono and asked nothing in return, and she represents whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, Thomas Drake, and a bunch more people a lot more important than cock.li. She has done a lot for this site and the world, and I would really appreciate her work being recognized. Thanks.

      <p>
        Donations are calculated such that any surplus or deficit is carried to the next month. This ensures that cock.li operates not-for-profit. You can read more details and financial reports on the <a href="/donate">Donate</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        It is my intention to operate cock.li as transparent as possible. To accomplish this I publish all communication I have with law enforcement including or regarding a demand or order for user information. All of this information is published on the <a href="/transparency">transparency</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Hidden Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Website: <a href='http://wwwcocklicdexedh.onion/'>wwwcocklicdexedh.onion</a></li>
        <li>Webmail: <a href='http://cockmailwwfvrtqj.onion/'>cockmailwwfvrtqj.onion</a></li>
        <li>IMAP, POP, and SMTP are not yet available via hidden services.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>How can I trust you?</h2>
  <p>
    You can't. Cock.li doesn't parse your E-mail to provide you with targeted ads, nor do I read E-mail contents unless it's for a legal court order. However, it is 100% possible for me to read E-mail, and IMAP/SMTP doesn't provide user-side/client-side encryption, so you're just going to have to take my word for it. Any encryption implementation would still technically allow me to read E-mail, too. This was true for Lavabit, too -- while your E-mail was stored encrypted (only if you were a paid member, which most people forget), E-mail could still technically be intercepted while being received / sent (SMTP), or while being read by your mail client (IMAP). For privacy, I would recommend encrypting your E-mails using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> using a mail client add-on like <a href="https://enigmail.net/home/index.php">Enigmail</a>.
