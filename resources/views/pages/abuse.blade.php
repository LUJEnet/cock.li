    Despite what some may tell you, cock.li does not tolerate abuse of its servers. To submit abuse, please include all relevant information as an E-mail to <a href="mailto:abuse@cock.li">abuse@cock.li</a>. Due to my privacy policy which protects my user's data, you will probably not receive a response (This is commonplace amongst E-mail providers). However, rest assured your complaint will be investigated promptly and thouroughly.

  <h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    I comply with all legal orders for user information in the USA and Romania. I do not give out data where I am not legally obligated to, so a subpoena or other <i>order</i> is required and requests will be ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for your subpoena / order to be processed, it must be sent to my lawyer. <strong>Do not send subpoenas to vc@cock.li or abuse@cock.li</strong>. Instead, E-mail or call me to request my lawyer's contact information.
